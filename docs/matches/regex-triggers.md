Regex triggers are a powerful alternative to regular ones, with a few extra
features:

-   They let you define triggers using a full-blown _regex syntax_, enabling
    use-cases that would be inconvenient or even impossible with regular
    triggers.
-   They accept _named groups_, which can be used to convenientely pass
    arguments to expansions or external scripts.

:::tip Before starting

This tutorial assumes you already know the basics of Regular expressions. If you
don't, these resources can be a good starting point:

## Basics

Before diving into the advanced topics, let's recap some of the basics. Let's
say we want to create a match that gets expanded to `Hello!` every time we write
`:greet2`.

With regular triggers, you could do the following:

```yaml
- trigger: ":greet2"
  replace: "Hello!"
```

After a while, you decide to extend the previous match to all single-digits,
such as `:greet1`, `:greet2`, `:greet3`, etc.

With regular triggers, your only option would be to list all the possible ones:

```yaml
- triggers:
      - ":greet1"
      - ":greet2"
      - ":greet3"
      - ":greet4"
      - ":greet5"
      - ":greet6"
      - ":greet7"
      - ":greet8"
      - ":greet9"
      - ":greet0"
  replace: "Hello!"
```

As you can see, this approach hardly scales with multiple variations.

On the other hand, Regex triggers let you define the previous match very
concisely:

```yaml
- regex: ":greet\\d"
  replace: "Hello!"
```

With this match, every time you write `:greet1` or `:greet7`, you'll get
`Hello!`

:::caution Escaping regexes

As you can see from the previous example, we had to write `:greet\\d` instead of
`:greet\d`. That's because we need to escape backslashes for it to be a valid
YAML double-quoted scalar. If the quote-marks around the string are omitted
(plain scalar) this isn't necessary, which can make debugging easier.

:::

Although this example showed an interesting use-case for regex triggers, it was
only the tip of the iceberg. Regex triggers really start to shine when used to
create _dynamic triggers_, which are explained in the next section.

## Arguments

The most significant difference between regular triggers and regex ones is that
the latter can be _dynamic_. For example, the following trigger would only match
with `:greet(John)`

```yaml
- trigger: ":greet(John)"
  replace: "Hi John!"
```

whereas we could define a regex trigger to match all names:

```yaml
- regex: ":greet\\(.*\\)"
  replace: "Hi John!"
```

The previous match works with any name. For example, both `:greet(Bob)` and
`:greet(Mark)` cause an expansion. Unfortunately, the match will always output
`Hi John!`, even when you specify other names.

To solve the problem, you'll need to use **named groups**, a really powerful
regex feature that integrates well with Espanso. Let's refactor the previous
example to use named groups:

```yaml
- regex: ":greet\\((?P<person>.*)\\)"
  replace: "Hi {{person}}!"
```

If you now type `:greet(Bob)`, you'll see `Hi Bob!` appear!

The key part is the `(?P<person>.*)` block in the middle, which "captures" the
text contained between the two outer parenthesis (the ones we escaped), inside
the `person` group.

The powerful thing is that **Espanso automatically converts named groups into
variables**, so that you can use them in replacements and scripts.

:::caution Named group syntax

Although regular expressions are supported by most programming languages, their
syntax can slightly vary between implementations. Espanso uses the
[regex](https://docs.rs/regex/1.5.4/regex/) library, which requires you to
specify named groups as follows:

```
(?P<name>exp)
```

TLDR: Make sure to specify that `P`, otherwise named groups won't work!

:::

Keep in mind that you don't have to enclose your arguments within parenthesis,
as that was only a matter of style. For example, you could also rewrite the
previous example as:

```yaml
- regex: "greet(?P<person>.*)\\."
  replace: "Hi {{person}}!"
```

Which would expand to `Hi Mark!` every time you write `greetMark.`. As you can
see, you can go crazy with it!

## Advanced examples

As explained in the previous section, Espanso automatically converts named
groups into variables. This makes it possible to use the value of a named group
inside scripts and shell commands, among other things.

In the next example, we are going to use the `expr` command line utility to
create a match that calculates and expands the sum between two numbers
dynamically.

```yaml
- regex: "=sum\\((?P<num1>.*?),(?P<num2>.*?)\\)"
  replace: "{{result}}"
  vars:
      - name: result
        type: shell
        params:
            cmd: "expr $ESPANSO_NUM1 + $ESPANSO_NUM2"
```

If you now type `=sum(3,4)`, Espanso will expand it to `7`!

In a nutshell, the two numbers are captured inside the `num1` and `num2` named
groups, which in turn are converted to Espanso variables. As with all variables,
you can use them inside the `shell` extension by reading the appropriate
environment variables. In this case we are passing them to the `expr` command.

If you want to know more about the variable injection logic, please read the
[Variables](../variables) section.

:::caution windows users

The `expr` command is not available by default on Windows, so the previous
example might not work on that platform. You can still apply the concepts to
other commands/scripts.

## When NOT to use Regex triggers

Although regex triggers could completely replace regular ones, you should only
use them when necessary. In other words, **if a regular trigger (or a simple
combination of them) could serve your needs, you should prefer them to regex
ones**.

That's because regex triggers, despite being more powerful, are also less
efficient than regular ones. Their performance shouldn't be a problem unless you
use thousands of them, but it's important to keep this in mind when defining
matches.

## Limitations

The current regex implementation is subject to a few limitations:

-   The maximum length of a "regex match" is set to 30 characters, including the
    captured named groups. For example, if your regex trigger is
    `:greet\\((?P<person>.*)\\)` and you type `:greet(Bob)`, you've consumed 11
    out of 30 characters. This limitation has been placed to improve
    performance, but we are planning to make this configurable. Please open an
    issue on GitHub if this is limiting you :)

-   As explained in the previous sections, Espanso uses a Regex implementation
    that doesn't support all Regex features. For more information, please see
    the library documentation: https://docs.rs/regex/1.5.4/regex/
