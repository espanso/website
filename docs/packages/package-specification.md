TODO: this section is under construction

In this document, we are going to discuss the format specification for Espanso
packages and repositories. If you are trying to create your first package, we
suggest reading the [Creating a Package](../creating-a-package) section first,
as that contains the basic information you'll need for most use-cases.

In the first part, we'll go through the structure of an Espanso package,
starting from a top level view with the included files, all the way down to the
actual content. Then, the second part covers the structure a typical package
repository.

## Packages format

As we first introduced in the [Creating a package](../creating-a-package)
section, **a package is a combination of YAML match files with some metadata.**

The most basic package _MUST_ contain these 3 files:

-   A `package.yml` file, containing the snippets you want to share.
-   A `_manifest.yml` file, containing the metadata of the package. This
    includes the package's name, author and version, among other things.
-   A `README.md` file, containing a description of the package, written using
    the [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) syntax.

Optionally, a package can also contain:

-   A `LICENSE` file, if you want to publish your package under a different
    license than the
    [default HUB one](https://github.com/espanso/hub/blob/main/LICENSE) (MIT).
-   Any number of additional YAML files, which can be used to split the matches
    across multiple files, to make them more manageable.

In the following sections, we'll examine them in detail, but first we'll need to
briefly discuss _package names_.

### Package name rules

**A package name can only contain lowercase letters, numbers and the hypen
symbol `-`.**

For example, the following are valid names:

-   `my-nice-package1234`
-   `great-package`

While these are NOT valid names:

-   `My Package`
-   `my_package`
-   `nice@package`

### The `package.yml` file

The `package.yml` file is the entry-point of the package. It contains the main
matches (aka _snippets_) for the current package, and its format is equivalent
to the `$CONFIG/match/base.yml` file, as explained [here](../../matches/basics).

As with regular match files, it can contain matches, global variables and import
rules. A typical `package.yml` file might look like the following:

```yaml title="package.yml"
matches:
    - trigger: ":hello"
      replace: "Hello from package"

    - trigger: ":another"
      replace: "Another snippet from the example package"
```

### The `_manifest.yml` file

The `_manifest.yml` file contains the package _metadata_, including the package
name, author and version. This file is encoded in the
[YAML syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML).

A `_manifest.yml` _MUST_ contain these fields:

-   `name` should be the name of your package. It must be equal to the directory
    name containing the package.
-   `title` is the "read friendly" version of your package name. This can
    contain all string characters, but it should be relatively short.
-   `description` should contain a short description of your package.
-   `version` contains the version of your package. We suggest to keep it at
    `0.1.0` for new packages.
-   `author` contains the author name.

Optionally, the manifest can also contain these fields:

-   `homepage` should be the link to your package's homepage. This could be a
    website, a documentation page or a Git repository.

:::info Note about package versions

As we discussed earlier, the `_manifest.yml` file also contains the package
version. This package version should follow the standard `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`
format.

When installing or updating a package, Espanso uses the version to determine if
an update should be performed or not. For this reason, we suggest increasing the
version after an update is made to the package.

If you don't to this, you'll need to use the `--force` option when updating.

:::

### The `README.md` file

The `README.md` file contains a description of the package, formatted with the
[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) syntax.

The main purpose of this file is to describe and document the package. For
example, if your package depends on an external script or command, this is a
good place to mention it.
