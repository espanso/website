As mentioned in the previous section, **Espanso can install packages from
multiple sources.** For most users, the official
[Espanso Hub](https://hub.espanso.org/) should be the preferred way to install
new packages, as those have been verified by the Espanso Team to guarantee
quality and security standards.

That said, **there are times when you might want to install packages from
outside the hub.** For example, you might want to create **private**,
company-specific packages to share with your collegues, or simply you want to
manage your packages intependently from the Hub.

:::tip Call for package creators

If you created a public package that could be useful to others, please consider
submitting it to the [Espanso Hub](https://hub.espanso.org/). Not only it's
free, but it also greatly helps the project and the community! :)

:::

This guide is divided in two parts, one about **public** alternatives to the
Hub, and one about **private** ones.

## Public alternatives

This section is about _public_ alternatives to the Hub, that is, other ways in
which you can install **public packages** without relying on the Hub. If you
wish to install private packages instead, please skip to the next section.

### GitHub or GitLab repositories

As long as the repository follows the
[Package Specification](../package-specification/) format, you can install a
package from any GitHub and GitLab repository by specifying the `--git` option.

For example, to install the `dummy-package` from our test
[dummy-repository](https://github.com/espanso/dummy-repository), we can run the
following command in a terminal:

```bash
espanso install dummy-package --git https://github.com/espanso/dummy-repository --external
```

### Git repositories

As long as the repository follows the
[Package Specification](../package-specification/) format, you can install a
package from any git repository by specifying the `--git` option.

:::caution `git` command must be installed!

Compared to the previous section where we installed a package from GitHub or
GitLab, **installing from a generic git repository requires the `git` command to
being installed**.

The `git` command is not needed on GitHub and GitLab because Espanso uses
platform-specific APIs to download the packages. On the other hand, Espanso uses
a `git clone` to fetch a package from other git repositories.

:::

For example, to install the `dummy-package` from our test
[dummy-repository](https://github.com/espanso/dummy-repository), we can run the
following command in a terminal:

```bash
espanso install dummy-package --git https://github.com/espanso/dummy-repository --external
```

## Private alternatives

This section is about _private_ alternatives to the Hub, that is, ways in which
you can install **private packages**. This is particularly useful in a company
environment, where you might want to share snippets with your team without
publishing them on the Hub.

### Git repositories

As long as the repository follows the
[Package Specification](../package-specification/) format, you can install a
package from any git repository by specifying the `--git` option.

:::caution Setting up `git`

With private repositories, Espanso currently relies on the `git` command to
fetch the contents of a private package. For this reason, make sure the `git`
command is installed on the machine (and properly added to the PATH) and that
permissions are set up correctly.

As a rule of thumb, **if you are able to run `git clone <your_repo_url>` on the
machine, then Espanso should install the package correctly**.

:::

For example, to install the `dummy-package` from our test
[dummy-repository](https://github.com/espanso/dummy-repository) (in this case,
assuming the repository was private), we can run the following command in a
terminal:

```bash
espanso install dummy-package --git https://github.com/espanso/dummy-repository --external
```
