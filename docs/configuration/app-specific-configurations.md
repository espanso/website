title: App-specific configurations
---

For simple use-cases, tuning Espanso's options in the `config/default.yml` file
works well, but as your needs become more complex, that mechanism might prove
limited. For example, you might want to customize the way Espanso behaves while
using a certain app, or disabling it entirely when using another.

App-specific configurations are designed to handle these use-cases. In a
nutshell, they are made of two important ingredients:

-   Some rules that define when the configuration should be active
-   The actual configuration options

App-specific configurations are _not_ yet supported in Wayland.

### Disabling Espanso when using a certain app

Let's start with a simple example. Let's say we would like to disable Espanso
while using Telegram. To do so, we'll create an app-specific configuration.
Start by creating the `config/telegram.yml` file, with the following content:

```yaml title="$CONFIG/config/telegram.yml"
filter_exec: Telegram
enable: false
```

Let's analyze the configuration step by step:

-   We first specify the `filter_exec` rule, which defines when this
    app-specific config will be active. In this case, the configuration will be
    active if the current app's executable path contains the string "Telegram".
    You'll learn all about available filters in the [Filters section](#filters).

-   We then set `enable: false`, disabling Espanso.

Espanso will now use the configuration defined in the `config/telegram.yml` file
while using Telegram and the default one while using other applications.

Inside the app-specific configuration you can define most of the options you
would customize in your `config/default.yml` file, with a few exceptions. You'll
find a list of customizable options in the [Options section](../options).

### Enable or disable some matches while using a specific application

Another common use-case for app-specific configurations is to **selectively
enable some matches while using a particular application**. For example, we
might want to enable some code snippets while using Visual Studio Code or
IntelliJ Idea, but not inside other apps.

This use-case is described in the
[Include and Exclude rules](../include-and-exclude) section.

## Understanding configuration inheritance

App-specific configurations extend the default one. For example, if your
`config/default.yml` file defines `option_A: 10` and `option_B: 20`, and your
app-specific configuration `config/specific.yml` defines `option_B: 30`, the
latter will be equivalent to:

```yaml
option_A: 10
option_B: 30
```

The `option_A` parameter was inherited by the default configuration, as shown in
this schema:

![Config inheritance](/img/docs/config-inheritance.png)

The key concept to remember is that **the app-specific configuration will be
equivalent to the default one, except for the options it changes directly**.

:::tip

Espanso's currently active configuration for a program can be shown in a popup
window by typing `#acfg#` from within it. Similarly, `#pacfg#` will paste the
details into the program so use with care!

## Filters

As said earlier, one of the key ingredients for app-specific configurations are
the filtering rules. These determine which configuration is active at any given
time.

These are the currently available filters:

| Filter         | Description                                                                                        | Windows Support                              | MacOS Support                   | Linux Support   |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | --------------- |
| `filter_title` | Filter based on the current window title.                                                          | Full support                                 | Full support                    | Full support    |
| `filter_exec`  | Filter based on the current application's executable path. For example, `C:\Programs\Telegram.exe` | Full support                                 | Full support                    | Partial support |
| `filter_class` | Filter based on the current window class. This is mostly relevant on Linux                         | Uses the application executable path instead | Uses the App identifier instead | Full support    |

Additionally, `filter_os`, accepts as a parameter `linux`, `macos` or `windows`,
and may be usefully combined with
[`extra_includes`](../include-and-exclude#difference-between-includes-and-extra_includes)
to separate OS-specific
[global variables](../../matches/variables/#injecting-global-variables) and
local shell expansions etc., when the Espanso configuration files are
[shared](../../sync) between different operating systems.

The `filter_title`, `filter_exec` and `filter_class` filters accept a **regex**
as parameter, so make sure to escape the special characters properly.

For example, if the current app title is `Google Chrome`:

-   `filter_title: Chrome` will match, as the string `Google Chrome` matches the
    regex `Chrome`
-   `filter_title: "^Chrome$"` will NOT match, as that regex matches only an app
    with the title _equal_ to `Chrome`.
-   `filter_title: "^Google Chrome$"` will match, as the string `Google Chrome`
    matches exactly the regex `Google Chrome`.

### Finding the right filters

:::tip

The method described below requires Espanso v2.1.1 or above, so make sure to
have an up-to-date version.

:::

Now that we covered the basics, let's discuss how to choose the right filter for
your use-case.

We should start by checking what information Espanso is detecting for the
current application, as that's what Espanso will use in the matching phase.

1. Open the desired application (in this example, I've opened the macOS's
   TextEdit app).
2. Inside the application, type `#detect#`
    - As an alternative, you can also open the Search bar, type `>` and then
      select `Show active application information (detect)`
3. A window should open, displaying the information about the active
   application:

![Detecting the active app](/img/docs/detectwindow.png)

`#pdetect#` can be used to paste the information directly into your application.

These are the values of `title`, `exec` and `class` detected for the active
application.

In this example, a good filter could be:

```
filter_class: "TextEdit"
```

Which would match against the detected class `com.apple.TextEdit`.

A good rule of thumb is to choose either the `filter_exec` or `filter_class`
filters for basic use-cases, as these values tend to be stable. In the next
section, we'll discuss an interesting use-case for `filter_title`.

:::caution Filters are often platform-dependent

If you are sharing your configuration across different machines, an important
consideration to make is that the same filters might not work across different
operating systems.

For example, if you define a `filter_exec` as follows:

```yaml
filter_exec: Telegram.exe
```

That would match Telegram on Windows, but not on macOS or Linux. To solve the
problem, you can either create filters that match all the possible app
locations/classes (filters are regexes, so you can also use
[alternation](https://www.regular-expressions.info/alternation.html)) or you can
create different app-specific configurations based on the platform, such as
`config/telegram_win.yml` and `config/telegram_linux.yml`.

:::

#### Advanced use-cases for `filter_title`

As mentioned in the previous section, `filter_title` is trickier to use than
`filter_class` and `filter_exec`, as its value is not stable over time. The
value often reflect the _content_ being displayed in the active application:

-   Inside a browser, the `title` might be the _webpage title_. For example, if
    you are visiting YouTube inside Chrome, the `title` is either `YouTube` or
    the video title.
-   Inside an editor, the `title` might refer to the file being edited. For
    example, while editing this documentation file inside Visual Studio Code,
    the detected title is
    `app-specific-configurations.md - website-espanso - Visual Studio Code`.

This opens up a few interesting use-cases. For example, you might create **an
app-specific configuration that only activates when _visiting a particular
website_**, or one that would only activate while editing a specific
project/document.

For example, here's a configuration that would disable Espanso when the active
page is YouTube:

```yaml title="config/disable_on_youtube.yml"
filter_title: YouTube
enable: false
```

> Note that, in addition to `default.yml`, only **one** app-specific
> configuration can apply at any time. In situations where more than one filter
> _could_ apply to the same program (e.g. a browser filter, and a tab filter)
> the first one alphabetically by file-name will be active. Name the filter
> files accordingly so that, in the example, a `filter_title` file overrides a
> more general `filter_exec` file.
