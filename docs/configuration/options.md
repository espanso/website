In this guide, we are going to discuss the available options to customize
Espanso. The first few sections are about the common parameters you might want
to change, but you'll also find a complete reference at the bottom for the
advanced ones.

## Customizing the Toggle Key

If you often need to **quickly enable and disable Espanso** during regular use,
you might want to customize the _Toggle Key_. When double pressed, the Toggle
Key disables Espanso, preventing any expansion. Double-pressing Alt again will
re-enable it.

:::info Changes in version 2.1.2

Prior to version 2.1.2, Espanso was configured to use the ALT key as
`toggle_key` by default. That was a major source of confusion, as many users
accidentally pressed it during normal use. For this reason, Espanso now ships
with the `toggle_key` _disabled_ by default.

:::

If you'd like to customize the key, simply add the `toggle_key` parameter to
your `$CONFIG/config/default.yml` configuration and set it to one of the
available options:

|              |             |               |              |
| ------------ | ----------- | ------------- | ------------ | ----- |
| `CTRL`       | `ALT`       | `SHIFT`       | `META`       | `OFF` |
| `LEFT_CTRL`  | `LEFT_ALT`  | `LEFT_SHIFT`  | `LEFT_META`  |
| `RIGHT_CTRL` | `RIGHT_ALT` | `RIGHT_SHIFT` | `RIGHT_META` |

For example, if you want to use the Right Control key to toggle Espanso, you can
add the following to your configuration:

```yaml title="$CONFIG/config/default.yml"
toggle_key: RIGHT_CTRL
```

:::tip About the META key

The `META` option refers to different keys depending on the platform. For
example, on macOS the `META` refers to Command (or CMD), while on Windows refers
to the "Win" key.

In other words, if you'd like to use the CMD key on macOS, you should specify
`META`.

:::

And if you'd rather turn it off, you can do so with:

```yml title="$CONFIG/config/default.yml"
toggle_key: OFF
```

## Customizing the Search bar

The Search bar is one of the most useful features, letting you choose the right
snippet without having to remember the trigger.

By default, the search bar can be opened in two ways:

-   By pressing ALT+Space (Option + Space on macOS)
-   By clicking on the status icon and then selecting "Open Search bar"
    (currently not available on Linux)

If for whatever reason you don't like the default shortcuts, you can customize
them as follows:

### Customizing the search shortcut

If you don't like the default Alt+Space shortcut, you can change it by adding
the following line to your `$CONFIG/config/default.yml` file:

```yaml title="$CONFIG/config/default.yml"
search_shortcut: ALT+SHIFT+SPACE
```

As you can see, the shortcut is defined by specifying all keys separated by a
plus sign. These are the supported keys:

`ALT`, `CTRL`, `CMD`, `SHIFT`, `ENTER`, `TAB`, `SPACE`, `META`, `OPTION`,
`INSERT`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `UP`, `END`, `HOME`, `PAGEDOWN`, `PAGEUP`,
`F1`, `F2`, `F3`, `F4`, `F5`, `F6`, `F7`, `F8`, `F9`, `F10`, `F11`, `F12`,
`F13`, `F14`, `F15`, `F16`, `F17`, `F18`, `F19`, `F20`, `A`, `B`, `C`, `D`, `E`,
`F`, `G`, `H`, `I`, `J`, `K`, `L`, `M`, `N`, `O`, `P`, `Q`, `R`, `S`, `T`, `U`,
`V`, `W`, `X`, `Y`, `Z`, `0`, `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, `6`, `7`, `8`, `9`,
`NUMPAD0`, `NUMPAD1`, `NUMPAD2`, `NUMPAD3`, `NUMPAD4`, `NUMPAD5`, `NUMPAD6`,
`NUMPAD7`, `NUMPAD8`, `NUMPAD9`

> Not all keyboard combinations have been tested. If you find a combination
> that's not working, please open a bug report on
> [GitHub](https://github.com/federico-terzi/espanso/issues). Thanks!

You can also disable this shortcut entirely by adding the following line:

```yaml title="$CONFIG/config/default.yml"
search_shortcut: off
```

### Customizing the search trigger

The search bar can also be configured to be shown after typing a trigger. For
example, you might tune it to be displayed after typing `.search` by adding this
option:

```yaml title="$CONFIG/config/default.yml"
search_trigger: ".search"
```

Or disable it entirely with:

```yaml title="$CONFIG/config/default.yml"
search_trigger: off
```

## Hiding the Icon

You can hide the Espanso status icon on the macOS menu bar or the Windows system
tray by adding the following option to your `$CONFIG/config/default.yml` file:

```yaml title="$CONFIG/config/default.yml"
show_icon: false
```

## Hiding the Notifications

You can hide the notifications by adding the following option to your
`$CONFIG/config/default.yml` config:

```yaml title="$CONFIG/config/default.yml"
show_notifications: false
```

## Options reference

Here's a list of all the available options. If the value of the `App-specific`
column is `Yes`, then the option can be used inside an
[App-specific configuration](../app-specific-configurations). Otherwise, the
option can only be defined inside the `$CONFIG/config/default.yml` file.
