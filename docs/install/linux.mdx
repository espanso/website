## Find the right version

To use Espanso on Linux, you first need to determine whether your system is running a X11 or Wayland desktop environment.
If you are unsure, please open a terminal and run the following command:

```bash
echo $XDG_SESSION_TYPE
```

> If the above command doesn't output anything, please try [with this method](https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/325972).

Now that you know your desktop environment, you're ready to choose the right method in the following section.

## Choosing the right install method

There are multiple installation methods on Linux.
This table summarizes them based on distribution and desktop environment:

| Distribution | X11 | Wayland |
|---|---|---|
| Ubuntu/Debian | **[DEB package](#deb-x11) (recommended)**, [AppImage](#appimage-x11), [Snap package](#snap-x11), [Manual compilation](#x11-compile) | **[DEB package](#deb-wayland) (recommended)**, [Manual compilation](#wayland-compile) |
| Fedora | **[AppImage](#appimage-x11) (recommended)**, [Manual compilation](#x11-compile) | [Manual compilation](#wayland-compile) |
| Arch/Manjaro | **[AppImage](#appimage-x11) (recommended)**, [Manual compilation](#x11-compile) | [Manual compilation](#wayland-compile) |
| Other distros | **[AppImage](#appimage-x11) (recommended)**, [Manual compilation](#x11-compile) | [Manual compilation](#wayland-compile) |

We are continously improving the installation process, so expect more user-friendly methods soon.

## Install on X11

### Installing with DEB package (Ubuntu/Debian) {#deb-x11}

Espanso ships with a `.deb` package, making the installation convenient on Debian-based systems.

Start by downloading the package by running the following command inside a terminal:

export const DebX11CodeLink = () => <CodeBlock>wget {getStableDownloadLink("LINUX_X11_DEB_DOWNLOAD_URL")}</CodeBlock>;

<DebX11CodeLink />

:::info Verifying package checksum

If you want to verify the correctness of the archive, in the Github Releases page you will find the SHA256 hash 
in the file `espanso-debian-x11-amd64-sha256.txt`

:::

You can now install the package using:

```
sudo apt install ./espanso-debian-x11-amd64.deb
```

<X11AfterInstall />

### Installing with AppImage (all distros) {#appimage-x11}

export const AppImageCodeLink= () => <CodeBlock className="language-bash">
{`# Create the $HOME/opt destination folder
mkdir -p ~/opt
# Download the AppImage inside it
wget -O ~/opt/Espanso.AppImage '${getStableDownloadLink("LINUX_X11_APP_IMAGE_DOWNLOAD_URL")}'
# Make it executable
chmod u+x ~/opt/Espanso.AppImage
# Create the "espanso" command alias
sudo ~/opt/Espanso.AppImage env-path register
`}</CodeBlock>;

To install the Espanso's AppImage, open a terminal and follow these steps:

<AppImageCodeLink/>

<X11AfterInstall />

### Installing with Snap {#snap-x11}

If you are using Ubuntu, you can also install Espanso by simply running this command:

```bash
sudo snap install espanso --classic --channel=latest/edge
```

<X11AfterInstall />

### Compiling from sources {#x11-compile}

#### Prerequisites

These are the basic tools required to build espanso:

* A recent Rust compiler. You can install it following these instructions: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
* A C/C++ compiler. On Linux, you should use the default C/C++ compiler (it's usually GCC). 
If you run the command specified in the next step, this will be included automatically.

* Install the required linux packages:
  * On **Ubuntu/Debian** run `sudo apt update && sudo apt install build-essential git libx11-dev libxtst-dev libxkbcommon-dev libdbus-1-dev libwxgtk3.0-gtk3-dev libssl-dev`
* Espanso heavily relies on [cargo make](https://github.com/sagiegurari/cargo-make) for the various packaging
steps. You can install it by running:

```
cargo install --force cargo-make --version 0.34.0
```

#### Compiling Espanso

Once you've got all the prerequisites, you can:

```bash
# Clone the Espanso repository
git clone https://github.com/federico-terzi/espanso

cd espanso

# Compile espanso in release mode
# NOTE: this will take a while (~5/15 minutes)
cargo make --profile release build-binary 
```

At this point, you should have the `espanso` binary available in the `target/release/` directory.

#### Installing Espanso

Once you've compiled Espanso, you can move it into the final location. A good option would be the `/usr/local/bin` folder:

```
sudo mv target/release/espanso /usr/local/bin/espanso
```

<X11AfterInstall />

## Install on Wayland

> Wayland support is currently experimental, therefore some features might be missing or not working well yet. 
> Known limitations include:
>
> * If you are using a non-us keyboard layout, you'll need to explicitly specify it in the settings (more on this below).
> * There is currently no support for App-specific configurations, which means we can't use patches
> (which are often necessary to support some terminals).
> * If you are using Gnome, Espanso causes a small "flicker" when using the clipboard backend. This does not happen
> on Sway.
> * If you connect a new keyboard, you will need to manually restart Espanso with `espanso restart`, otherwise
> Espanso won't detect it.
>
> If you encounter a bug, please [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/federico-terzi/espanso/issues),
> any help is greatly appreciated! :)


### Installing with DEB package (Ubuntu/Debian) {#deb-wayland}

Espanso ships with a `.deb` package, making the installation convenient on Debian-based systems.

Start by downloading the package by running the following command inside a terminal:

export const DebWaylandCodeLink = () => <CodeBlock>wget {getStableDownloadLink("LINUX_WAYLAND_DEB_DOWNLOAD_URL")}</CodeBlock>;

<DebWaylandCodeLink />

:::info Verifying package checksum

If you want to verify the correctness of the archive, in the Github Releases page you will find the SHA256 hash 
in the file `espanso-debian-wayland-amd64-sha256.txt`

:::

You can now install the package using:

```
sudo apt install ./espanso-debian-wayland-amd64.deb
```

The process is almost complete, you just need to grant the required capabilities.

  * On **Fedora** run `sudo dnf install @development-tools gcc-c++ wl-clipboard libxkbcommon-devel dbus-devel wxGTK3-devel`
* Espanso heavily relies on [cargo make](https://github.com/sagiegurari/cargo-make) for the various packaging

cargo make --profile release --env NO_X11=true build-binary 
```

At this point, you should have the `espanso` binary available in the `target/release/` directory.

#### Installing Espanso

A good option would be the `/usr/local/bin` folder:

```
sudo mv target/release/espanso /usr/local/bin/espanso
