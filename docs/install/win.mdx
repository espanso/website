Espanso is compatible with Windows 10 or later, currently only on x64 architecture. ARM support is planned in the future, you can follow its development on [this issue](https://github.com/federico-terzi/espanso/issues/290).

### Download Espanso

You can either install espanso with the Installer or run it as a portable application by downloading the archive.

import {getStableDownloadLink} from '/src/utils/versionUtils.js';

<div className="">
<a className="btn btn-lg mybtn mb-4" href={getStableDownloadLink("WIN_INSTALLER_DOWNLOAD_URL")} role="button">Download the Installer (x64)</a>
<a className="btn btn-lg mybtn mb-4" href={getStableDownloadLink("WIN_PORTABLE_DOWNLOAD_URL")} role="button">Download Portable zip (x64)</a>
</div>

If you completed the installation procedure, you should have espanso running. At this point, you are ready to read the [Getting Started](/docs/get-started/) tutorial.

### Problems you may experience

Given that Espanso's digital signature is still relatively new, you may experience a warning from
Windows Smartscreen. In this case, just click on "More info" (1) and then
on "Run anyway" (2), as shown in the picture:
