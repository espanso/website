Espanso is compatible with Windows 10 or later, currently only on x64
architecture. ARM support is planned in the future, you can follow its
development on
[this issue](https://github.com/federico-terzi/espanso/issues/290).

### Download Espanso

You can either install espanso with the Installer or run it as a portable
application by downloading the archive.

import { getStableDownloadLink } from "/src/utils/versionUtils.js";

<div className="">
    <a
        className="btn btn-lg mybtn mb-4"
        href={getStableDownloadLink("WIN_INSTALLER_DOWNLOAD_URL")}
        role="button"
    >
        Download the Installer (x64)
    </a>
    <a
        className="btn btn-lg mybtn mb-4"
        href={getStableDownloadLink("WIN_PORTABLE_DOWNLOAD_URL")}
        role="button"
    >
        Download Portable zip (x64)
    </a>
</div>

If you completed the installation procedure, you should have espanso running. At
this point, you are ready to read the [Getting Started](/docs/get-started/)
tutorial.

### Problems you may experience

Given that Espanso's digital signature is still relatively new, you may
experience a warning from Windows Smartscreen. In this case, just click on "More
info" (1) and then on "Run anyway" (2), as shown in the picture:
