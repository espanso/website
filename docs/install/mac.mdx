Espanso currently support macOS 10.13 or greater on both Intel and Apple Silicon architectures.
You can install Espanso both as a traditional app bundle or by using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

## Install as App Bundle

The easiest way to install Espanso is by downloading the appropriate app bundle. 
Make sure to choose the right version based on your processor.

import {getStableDownloadLink} from '/src/utils/versionUtils.js';

<div className="">
<a className="btn btn-lg mybtn mb-4" href={getStableDownloadLink("MAC_UNIVERSAL_DOWNLOAD_URL")} role="button">Download Espanso (Universal binary)</a>
</div>

After you've downloaded the archive, uncompress it and move it into your `/Applications` folder.

## Install using Homebrew

Espanso can also be installed through [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), a popular macOS package manager.

```
brew install espanso
```

If the process succeeds, you'll find an Espanso app inside your `/Applications` folder.

:::info Users coming from version 0.7.3

If you're coming from an older version of Espanso installed via Homebrew, you may need to remove the
previous Homebrew tap first with the following command:

```
brew untap federico-terzi/espanso
```

or 

```
brew untap espanso/espanso
```
