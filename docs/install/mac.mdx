Espanso currently support macOS 10.13 or greater on both Intel and Apple Silicon (M1) architectures.
You can install Espanso both as a traditional app bundle or by using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

## Install as App Bundle

The easiest way to install Espanso is by downloading the appropriate app bundle. 
Make sure to choose the right version based on your processor.

import {getStableDownloadLink} from '/src/utils/versionUtils.js';

<div className="">
<a className="btn btn-lg mybtn mb-4" href={getStableDownloadLink("MAC_INTEL_DOWNLOAD_URL")} role="button">Download Espanso (Intel)</a>
<a className="btn btn-lg mybtn mb-4" href={getStableDownloadLink("MAC_M1_DOWNLOAD_URL")} role="button">Download Espanso (Apple Silicon M1)</a>
</div>

After you've downloaded the archive, uncompress it and move it into your `/Applications` folder.

## Install using Homebrew

Espanso can also be installed through [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), a popular macOS package manager.

Because Espanso is hosted outside the core homebrew repository, you'll first need to add the appropriate
_tap_ by running the following command inside a terminal:

```
brew tap espanso/espanso
```

Then, you can install Espanso by running the following command:

```
brew install espanso
```

If the process succeeded, you'll find an Espanso app inside your `/Applications` folder.

:::info Users coming from version 0.7.3

If you're coming from version 0.7.3 or earlier, you'll need to remove the previous Homebrew tap
first with the following command:

```
brew untap federico-terzi/espanso
```
