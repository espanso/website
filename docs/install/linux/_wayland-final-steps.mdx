#### Adding the required Capabilities

Espanso requires access to the `/dev/input/eventX` and `/dev/uinput` interfaces to detect triggers and inject expansions respectively. 
Although you could run it as root to grant the necessary permissions, Espanso supports a safer alternative
that consists in adding the `CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE` capability to the binary's set of **Permitted** ones. To do so, run the following command:

```bash
sudo setcap "cap_dac_override+p" $(which espanso)
```

:::info Security considerations

 In a nutshell, this capability grants Espanso the permissions to read and write to any file in the system, **but only when explicitly activated by the binary itself**.

 To limit the attack surface, Espanso performs the following steps:
* When started, the `CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE` capability is contained in the `Permitted` set. At this point, **Espanso CANNOT access arbitrary files in the system, as this is only possible once the `CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE` is moved to the `Effective` set**.
* After a partial initialization of the various modules, Espanso moves the `CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE` permission to the `Effective` set and opens the necessary interfaces to the `/dev/input/eventX` and `/dev/uinput` files.
* Immediately after, the `Permitted` and `Effective` sets are cleared, meaning Espanso cannot access privileged files anymore. Moreover, because the `Permitted` set was cleared as well, the process won't be able to grant the permission again.

 In short, Espanso uses the `CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE` permission only when opening the `/dev/input*` interfaces, and ungrant that permission immediately after.

#### Final steps

Now run `espanso --version`. If you see the version appear, it means Espanso was successfully installed!

To complete the configuration, run these commands:

```bash
# Register espanso as a systemd service (required only once)
espanso service register

# Start espanso
espanso start
```

> If you don't want to use espanso as a Systemd service, you can also start it in unmanaged mode with `espanso start --unmanaged`. Keep in mind that Espanso will not start automatically when running in unmanaged mode, so you will need to do so manually.

:::caution A note for non-US users

If you are using a non-US keyboard layout, you'll need to specify its "code" into
the `$CONFIG/config/default.yml` file as follows:

```yaml
# For example, this is what I use for the Italian layout
keyboard_layout:
  layout: "it"
```
