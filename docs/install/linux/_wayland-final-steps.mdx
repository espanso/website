#### Adding the required Capabilities

Espanso requires access to the `/dev/input/eventX` and `/dev/uinput` interfaces
to detect triggers and inject expansions respectively. Although you could run it
as root to grant the necessary permissions, Espanso supports a safer alternative
that consists in adding the `CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE` capability to the binary's set of
**Permitted** ones. To do so, run the following command:

```bash
sudo setcap "cap_dac_override+p" $(which espanso)
```

:::info Security considerations

In a nutshell, this capability grants Espanso the permissions to read and write
to any file in the system, **but only when explicitly activated by the binary
itself**.

To limit the attack surface, Espanso performs the following steps:

-   When started, the `CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE` capability is contained in the
    `Permitted` set. At this point, **Espanso CANNOT access arbitrary files in
    the system, as this is only possible once the `CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE` is moved to
    the `Effective` set**.
-   After a partial initialization of the various modules, Espanso moves the
    `CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE` permission to the `Effective` set and opens the necessary
    interfaces to the `/dev/input/eventX` and `/dev/uinput` files.
-   Immediately after, the `Permitted` and `Effective` sets are cleared, meaning
    Espanso cannot access privileged files anymore. Moreover, because the
    `Permitted` set was cleared as well, the process won't be able to grant the
    permission again.

In short, Espanso uses the `CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE` permission only when opening the
`/dev/input*` interfaces, and ungrant that permission immediately after.

#### Final steps

Now run `espanso --version`. If you see the version appear, it means Espanso was
successfully installed!

To complete the configuration, run these commands:

```bash
# Register espanso as a systemd service (required only once)
espanso service register

# Start espanso
espanso start
```

> If you don't want to use espanso as a Systemd service, you can also start it
> in unmanaged mode with `espanso start --unmanaged`. Keep in mind that Espanso
> will not start automatically when running in unmanaged mode, so you will need
> to do so manually.

:::caution A note for non-US users

If you are using a non-US keyboard layout, you'll need to specify its "code"
into the `$CONFIG/config/default.yml` file as follows:

```yaml
# For example, this is what I use for the Italian layout
keyboard_layout:
    layout: "it"
```
