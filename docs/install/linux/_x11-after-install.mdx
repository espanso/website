From now on, you should have the `espanso` command available in the terminal (you can verify by running `espanso --version`).

At this point, you are ready to use espanso by registering it first as a Systemd service and then starting it with:

```bash
# Register espanso as a systemd service (required only once)
espanso service register

# Start espanso
espanso start
```

> If you don't want to use espanso as a Systemd service, you can also start it in unmanaged mode with `espanso start --unmanaged`. Keep in mind that Espanso will not start automatically when running in unmanaged mode, so you will need to do so manually.

You are now ready to read the [Getting Started](../../get-started) tutorial!
