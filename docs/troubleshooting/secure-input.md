:::tip For Linux and Windows users

This section is only relevant for macOS users, so if you're using
Windows or Linux you can safely skip it.

If at some point Espanso stops working and its icon becomes as shown below, it means _Secure Input_
was activated:

Secure Input is a macOS security feature that prevents applications from
performing all accessibility-related tasks, including Espanso's expansions,
when inside a sensitive context, such as a password field.

:::tip Using Espanso inside password fields

This is the reason why Espanso won't work inside password fields on macOS.

:::

Despite being a useful feature to improve the overall system's security,
**Secure Input is often unreliable, getting "stuck" in the Secure mode even
when not necessary**.
In those cases, you'll need to "unlock" Secure Input for Espanso to start working again.

**The most common cause for Secure Input "locking" is having a Password Manager
activate in the background**, but there could be other causes.
Here's a list of possible **workarounds**:

* Close and reopen your Password Manager.
* If you're using a Password Manager _Browser extension_, close and reopen the browser.
* Launching the _SecureInput auto-fix_ by clicking on the Espanso icon in the status bar and selecting
`Launch SecureInput auto-fix`, sometimes that helps. If the auto-fix is not working, or you
want more information about it, please read the [Auto-fix section](#auto-fix).
* Slowly close all applications until Espanso unlocks (you can see the regular icon appear
in the status bar). With this process you can determine which application is causing the "lock".
* Logging out and logging back in.
* You can also examine the Espanso's log to get more information, although Espanso can't 
always tell which application is causing the Secure Input "lock".


:::info Why does Secure Input get stuck?

Although the exact causes are not known (being implemented in the proprietary side of macOS),
experiments show that Secure Input usually get "stuck" when **an application request
Secure Input while in the background**.

To reproduce this behavior, I've created a small example page on [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/macos-secure-input-stuck-demo-5jpg2). Follow the instructions on the right to try it out.

## Auto-fix

Espanso includes an experimental "SecureInput auto-fixer" which tries to go through some of the workarounds explained in the previous section automatically. It probably only works in the Catalina, Big Sur, and Monterey versions of macOS.

To launch it, you can click on the Espanso icon in the status bar on top, and then
selecting "Launch SecureInput auto-fix".

Keep in mind you might need to explicitly enable the Automation permissions
in the System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy tab > Automation, as shown
in the picture below (first click on the Lock and then check all the checkboxes).

:::info Auto-fix implementation

If you're curious about the actual implementation details, you'll find the [auto-fix 
source code on GitHub](https://github.com/federico-terzi/espanso/blob/master/espanso/src/cli/workaround/secure_input.rs).
