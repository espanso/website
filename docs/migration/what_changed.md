Although the v2 strives to be backward compatible, the configuration format has
slightly changed. Luckily, Espanso comes with an automatic migration tool that
makes the switch almost painless.

Before diving into the tool though, we are going to explore the main changes.

### New configuration format

Previously, configurations and matches were defined in the same file (usually
the `default.yml` file). In v2, the two have been split:

-   You should now define your matches and global variables in the
    `$CONFIG/match/base.yml` file.
-   Other configuration options (like `toggle_key` or `backend`) should be
    defined in the `$CONFIG/config/default.yml` file.

For example, this legacy config file:

```yml title="$CONFIG/default.yml"
backend: Clipboard

matches:
    - trigger: ":espanso"
      replace: "Hi there!"
```

would be divided in two separate files:

```yml title="$CONFIG/match/base.yml"
matches:
    - trigger: ":espanso"
      replace: "Hi there!"
```

```yml title="$CONFIG/config/default.yml"
backend: Clipboard
```

Espanso comes with an automatic migration tool, simply launch it and the wizard
will ask you to migrate the configurations automatically.

For a deeper walkthrough on the new configuration format, please read the
[Configuration changes section](../configuration_changes).

### New Form's control syntax

In previous versions, you could define Form's controls with the same
curly-bracket syntax as variables:

```yaml
- trigger: ":greet"
  form: |
      Hey {{name}},
      Happy Birthday!
```

Since version 2.1.0-alpha, you'll need to use double square-brackets to define
controls instead, such as:

```yaml
- trigger: ":greet"
  form: |
      Hey [[name]],
      Happy Birthday!
```

This breaking change was needed to support the new variable injection mechanism,
for which the curly-brackets syntax `{{name}}` is reserved.

If you run the automatic migration tool, Espanso will take care of converting
the syntax for you.

### Search bar

Espanso now comes with a search bar. You can open it by clicking on the Espanso
icon > Open Search bar (currently not available on Linux) or by pressing
`ALT+SPACE` (or `OPTION+SPACE` on macOS). You can customize the shortcut with
this option (you should add them into the `default.yml` file):

```yaml
search_shortcut: "ALT+SPACE"
```

### Regex triggers

You can now write full-blown regex triggers with named groups:

```yaml
- regex: ":hi\\((?P<name>.*?)\\)"
  replace: "Hey {{name}}!"
```

The named group name is injected as a variable.

> Only use Regex triggers when necessary, as their performance is significantly
> slower than regular triggers.

> Currently there is a limit of 30-chars in the regex trigger (including the
> argument) due to performance reasons. We are working to make this limit
> configurable, but we are not yet there.

### Distribution format

Espanso v2 slightly changes the preferred distribution format on some platforms.

#### macOS

Espanso is now a regular App Bundle on macOS, currently available for both Intel
and M1 architectures.

#### Linux

Espanso now ships as an AppImage by default for X11 systems. We are still
deciding the optimal distribution format for Wayland systems.

#### Windows

You can now use the official installer or the **Portable** mode to use Espanso
on Windows.

### Toggle key disabled by default

Prior to version 2.1.2, Espanso was configured to use the ALT key as
`toggle_key` by default. That was a major source of confusion, as many users
accidentally pressed it during normal use. For this reason, Espanso now ships
with the toggle_key disabled by default.

If you want to keep using it, you can explicitly specify it in your
configuration, as
[described here](../../configuration/options/#customizing-the-toggle-key).

### New Package system

Espanso v2 ships with a new and improved package system. We are still working
out the last details, so **currently is not possible to install a package from
the Espanso Hub**, but we are working to make this available as soon as
possible.

Among the new features, you can now:

-   Install a package from private git repositories
-   Install a package from GitLab repositories

:::tip

You will need to move your legacy `/packages` folder to
`$CONFIG/match/packages`, to keep them working in v2.

### Experimental Wayland support

Espanso v2 ships with experimental Wayland support. There are still some rough
edges to be solved before considering the experience stable, but it should be
quite usable already.

Please report any bug that you experience on GitHub! :)

### Other changes

-   The GUI layer _modulo_ is now built-in into Espanso, and does not require a
    separate binary.
-   Espanso now uses native notifications on Windows.
-   New Choice Extension

Espanso v2 ships with many other changes that were not documented in this
section yet. We are in the process of rewriting the docs, so please be patient
:)
