The linux installation depends on the distro you are using. 
Espanso has been tested in the following distros, but you shouldn't 
have many problems making it work on others.

* [Ubuntu/Debian](#installing-on-ubuntu--debian)
* [Manjaro/Arch](#installing-on-manjaro--arch)

#### Wayland support

Currently espanso supports X11 systems only, but future support for Wayland is being investigated. Follow [this issue](https://github.com/federico-terzi/espanso/issues/287) to stay updated.

### Installing on Ubuntu / Debian

You can install espanso in various ways on Debian-based systems. As of now, the recommended ways are either `SNAP` or the `DEB` package.

#### Installing using SNAP

If you are using Ubuntu, the easiest way to install espanso is by using [snap](https://snapcraft.io/).

Open a terminal and type:

```
sudo snap install espanso --classic
```

> For more information about this method, check out the [snap page](https://snapcraft.io/espanso).

> **Important**: if you are upgrading espanso, after the previous command, execute `espanso unregister` in the terminal.

You should now have espanso installed in your system. To start it, type the following command:

```
espanso start
```

If you now type `:espanso` in any text field, you should see "Hi there!" appear! 

> **Note**: after executing the previous command, espanso will prompt the user to register a Systemd service. This is needed to automatically start espanso at system startup.

At this point, you should [install `modulo`](#installing-modulo) to enable the GUI features.

#### Installing using DEB package

Espanso ships with a `.deb` package, which makes it pretty convenient to install on Debian-based systems.

Start by downloading the latest release:

```
wget https://github.com/federico-terzi/espanso/releases/download/v0.7.3/espanso-debian-amd64.deb
```

> If you want to verify the correctness of the archive, in the [Github Releases](https://github.com/federico-terzi/espanso/releases/) page you will find the **SHA256** hash in the file `espanso-debian-amd64-sha256.txt`.

You can now install the package using:

```
sudo apt install ./espanso-debian-amd64.deb
```

You should now have espanso installed in your system. To start it, type the following command:

```
espanso start
```

If you now type `:espanso` in any text field, you should see "Hi there!" appear! 

> **Note**: after executing the previous command, espanso will prompt the user to register a Systemd service. This is needed to automatically start espanso at system startup.

At this point, you should [install `modulo`](#installing-modulo) to enable the GUI features.

#### Manual installation

Espanso depends upon the `X11 Record Extension`, the `xdo library`, the `xclip` command and
the `libnotify-bin` library, so you will need to install 
those first with the following commands:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install libxtst6 libxdo3 xclip libnotify-bin
```

You can now download the latest espanso release:
```
curl -L https://github.com/federico-terzi/espanso/releases/download/v0.7.3/espanso-linux.tar.gz | tar -xz -C /tmp/
```

> If you want to verify the correctness of the archive, in the [Github Releases](https://github.com/federico-terzi/espanso/releases/) page you will find the **SHA256** hash in the file `espanso-linux-sha256.txt`.

And then move it to the `/usr/local/bin/` directory

```
sudo mv /tmp/espanso /usr/local/bin/espanso
```

> If you want to avoid using `sudo`, you can move espanso in the `~/.local/bin` directory instead. Make sure that the `~/.local/bin` directory is in the `PATH`. If not present, you may need to reboot the system.

You should now have espanso installed in your system. To start it, type the following command:

```
espanso start
```

If you now type `:espanso` in any text field, you should see "Hi there!" appear! 

> **Note**: after executing the previous command, espanso will prompt the user to register a Systemd service. This is needed to automatically start espanso at system startup.

At this point, you should [install `modulo`](#installing-modulo) to enable the GUI features.

### Installing on Manjaro / Arch

There are multiple ways to install espanso on Arch: the preferred method is by using the [AUR](#installing-from-aur) package,
but you can also install it manually from the [prebuilt executables](#installing-from-the-prebuilt-release).

#### Installing from AUR

The official way to install espanso on Arch-based systems is by using one of the AUR packages, currently maintained by [Scrumplex](https://scrumplex.net/). There are multiple options available:

* [espanso](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/espanso/) - Builds from the latest (stable) release.
* [espanso-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/espanso-git/) - Builds from latest commit (in dev branch).

When you are ready, you can install espanso with:

```
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/espanso.git
cd espanso
makepkg -si
```

You should now have espanso installed in your system. To start it, type the following command:

```
espanso start
```

If you now type `:espanso` in any text field, you should see "Hi there!" appear! 

> **Note**: after executing the previous command, espanso will prompt the user to register a Systemd service. This is needed to automatically start espanso at system startup.

At this point, you should [install `modulo`](#installing-modulo) to enable the GUI features.
 
#### Installing from the prebuilt release

Espanso depends upon the `X11 Record Extension`, the `xdo library`, the `xclip` command and the
`libnotify` library, so you will need to install those first with the following commands:

```
sudo pacman -Sy
sudo pacman -S libxtst xdotool xclip libnotify
```

You can now download the latest espanso release:
```
curl -L https://github.com/federico-terzi/espanso/releases/download/v0.7.3/espanso-linux.tar.gz | tar -xz -C /tmp/
```

> If you want to verify the correctness of the archive, in the [Github Releases](https://github.com/federico-terzi/espanso/releases/) page you will find the **SHA256** hash in the file `espanso-linux-sha256.txt`.

And then move it to the `/usr/local/bin/` directory

```
sudo mv /tmp/espanso /usr/local/bin/espanso
```

> If you want to avoid using `sudo`, you can move espanso in the `~/.local/bin` directory instead. Make sure that the `~/.local/bin` directory is in the `PATH`. If not present, you may need to reboot the system.

You should now have espanso installed in your system. To start it, type the following command:

```
espanso start
```

If you now type `:espanso` in any text field, you should see "Hi there!" appear! 

> **Note**: after executing the previous command, espanso will prompt the user to register a Systemd service. This is needed to automatically start espanso at system startup.

At this point, you should [install `modulo`](#installing-modulo) to enable the GUI features.

### Installing Modulo

Since version 0.7.0, espanso introduced a few gui-related features that require [modulo](https://github.com/federico-terzi/modulo) to be installed in your system. **While not strictly required, it's highly suggested to install it enable some very useful features, such as Forms.**.

#### Manual installation

Installing modulo is pretty straight forward, being it packaged as an AppImage. Here's the list of suggested steps:

```bash
# Make sure to have the $HOME/opt directory
mkdir -p $HOME/opt

# Download the latest Modulo AppImage in the $HOME/opt
wget https://github.com/federico-terzi/modulo/releases/latest/download/modulo-x86_64.AppImage -O $HOME/opt/modulo.AppImage

# Make it executable:
chmod u+x $HOME/opt/modulo.AppImage

# Create a link to make modulo available as "modulo"
sudo ln -s $HOME/opt/modulo.AppImage /usr/bin/modulo
```

Note that these steps can be changed in many ways, the only requirement is that the modulo binary is available as `modulo` in the PATH.

#### Installing on Manjaro / Arch

Similarily to espanso itself, there are multiple ways to install modulo on Arch: You can either use the [manual method above](#manual-installation-1) or install it using the [AUR](#installing-from-aur-1) package.

##### Installing from AUR

The official way to install modulo on Arch-based systems is by using one of the AUR packages, currently maintained by [Scrumplex](https://scrumplex.net/). There are multiple options available:

* [modulo](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/modulo/) - Builds from the latest (stable) release.
* [modulo-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/modulo-git/) - Builds from the latest commit (in dev branch)

After you chose the package you want, you can install modulo with:
```
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/modulo.git
cd modulo
makepkg -si
```


At this point, you are ready to read the [Getting Started](../../get-started/) tutorial.
