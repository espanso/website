In this section, we will cover the basics of espanso to get you started
immediately. Make sure to [install espanso](/install) before diving into the
next sections.

### Starting espanso

If you followed the installation correctly, **espanso will be automatically
started** when you power up your computer. There are times, however, when you
may need to start espanso explicitly.

It's very easy to check if espanso is currently running: if you're using
**MacOS** or **Windows**, you should see the **icon in the status bar**. If you
don't see it, or if you're using **Linux**, another way to check it is to **open
a terminal** and type:

```bash
espanso status
```

If you see "`espanso is not running`", then you'll need to start espanso
manually with the following command:

```bash
espanso start
```

At this point you are ready to use espanso. Open any typing application and type
`:espanso`, you should see `Hi there!` appear.

If you don't see it, make sure espanso is currently running. You could also try
to repeat the installation procedure.

### Understanding Matches

espanso works by **detecting** your keypresses and **replacing** them when they
match a specific keyword, called _trigger_.

![How espanso works](/img/docs/match1.png)

The rule that associate the _trigger_ with the _replaced text_ is called
**Match** and is a core concept of espanso. Matches are very flexible and
powerful to solve many tasks. You can learn all about Matches in their
[documentation](../matches/) page.

espanso ships with very few built-in Matches to give you the maximum
flexibility, but you can expand its capabilities in two ways: creating your own
**custom matches** or **installing packages**. Both of these possibilities are
introduced below.

### Configuration

espanso uses a **file-based configuration** approach, following the Unix
philosophy. All configuration files reside in the `espanso` directory, whose
location depends on the current OS:

-   Linux: `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/espanso` (e.g. `/home/user/.config/espanso`)
-   macOS: `$HOME/Library/Preferences/espanso` (e.g.
    `/Users/user/Library/Preferences/espanso`)
-   Windows: `{FOLDERID_RoamingAppData}\espanso` (e.g.
    `C:\Users\user\AppData\Roaming\espanso`)

A quick way to find the path of your configuration folder is by using the
following command:

```bash
espanso path
```

> By default, configuration folder is hidden in most systems. To open it, copy
> path of your configuration folder and paste it in the address bar (aka path
> bar) of your file manager/explorer.

While this folder may contain many different files, let's focus on the most
important one: `default.yml`.

The `default.yml` file contain the **main espanso configuration** and uses the
widely spread [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) syntax. It can be used
to change various settings as well as **creating custom matches**. You can learn
all about espanso's configuration by visiting the
[documentation](../configuration).

### Creating your own Match

That's enough theory for now, let's start with some action! Let's say you write
a lot of emails, and you're tired of writing the greetings at the end, so you
decide to speed up the process.

We will configure espanso so that every time you type `:br`, it will be expanded
to:

```bash
Best Regards,
Jon Snow
```

By now you should know that we need to **define a Match**.

With your favourite text editor, open the `espanso/default.yml` file, introduced
previously in the [Configuration](#configuration) section. You should see
something like:

```yml
# espanso configuration file

# This is the default configuration file, change it as you like it
# You can refer to the official documentation:
# https://espanso.org/docs/

# Matches are the substitution rules, when you type the "trigger" string
# it gets replaced by the "replace" string.
matches:
    # Simple text replacement
    - trigger: ":espanso"
      replace: "Hi there!"
```

We need to define a new Match, so in the `matches:` section, add the following
code:

```yml
- trigger: ":br"
  replace: "Best Regards,\nJon Snow"
```

**Make sure to include the indentation**, otherwise it won't be valid YAML
syntax. You should get something like:

```yml
# espanso configuration file

# This is the default configuration file, change it as you like it
# You can refer to the official documentation:
# https://espanso.org/docs/

# Matches are the substitution rules, when you type the "trigger" string
# it gets replaced by the "replace" string.
matches:
    # Simple text replacement
    - trigger: ":espanso"
      replace: "Hi there!"

    - trigger: ":br"
      replace: "Best Regards,\nJon Snow"
```

We're almost there! After every configuration change, **espanso must be
restarted**. Recent versions **automatically restart when a file change is
detected**, but if you disabled that option, you'll need to do so manually by
opening a terminal and typing:

```bash
espanso restart
```

Now try to type `:br` anywhere. If you did everything correctly, you should see
`Best Regards` appear!

##### macOS remarks

If are using built-in macOS text replacement (System Preferences > Keyboard >
Text - note that these will sync from iDevices if you have iCloud sync enabled),
and have any triggers that overlap with espanso (the Replace column in System
Preferences), you may find that you get double expansions. Starting your espanso
trigger with `/` will prevent macOS text replacement from triggering as well
(ex: `/br` instead of `:br`).

#### Quick Editing

If you are comfortable using the terminal to edit your configs, you can also use
the much quicker:

```
espanso edit
```

command in the terminal, which spawns an instance of the system-default text
editor and automatically restarts espanso on exit.

By default it uses Nano on Unix and Notepad on Windows, but you can customize it
as you like. Take a look at [Quick Editing](../configuration/#quick-editing) for
more information.

### Understanding Packages

Custom matches are amazing, but sometimes it can be tedious to define Matches
for every common operation, and even more when you want to **share them with
other people**.

espanso offers an easy way to **share and reuse matches** with other people,
**packages**. In fact, they are so important that espanso includes a **build-in
package manager** and a **store**, the [espanso hub](https://hub.espanso.org/).

If you are lucky enough, someone might have already written a **package** to
include the matches you need! Otherwise, you can create a package and publish it
on the hub, for more information check out the [Packages](../packages/)
documentation.

### Installing a Package

Let's say you want to **add some emojis** to espanso, such that when you type
`:ok` it gets expanded to 👍.

A solution would be to install the
[Basic Emojis](https://hub.espanso.org/packages/basic-emojis/) package from the
[espanso hub](https://hub.espanso.org/) store. Open a terminal and type:

```bash
espanso install basic-emojis
```

At this point, as we did with custom matches, we need to **restart espanso**. We
can do so with the command:

```bash
espanso restart
```

If you now type `:ook` into any text field, you should see 👍👍👍👍 appear!

### Useful shortcuts

Let's conclude this introduction with the most important shortcuts espanso
offers, the **toggle shortcut** and the **backspace undo**.

#### Toggle Key

There are times when you may want to **disable espanso to avoid an unwanted
expansion**. This can be easily accomplished by quickly **double pressing the
`ALT` key** ( Option on MacOS ). You should then see a notification showing
"Espanso disabled".

At this point, espanso will be disabled and will not expand any match. To
**re-enable** it, double press the `ALT` key again.

**You can disable or change the toggle key**. Take a look at
[Customizing the Toggle Key](../configuration/#customizing-the-toggle-key)

#### Backspace Undo

> This feature was introduced in version 0.7.0, so make sure to have an
> up-to-date version.

It might happen to accidentally trigger an expansion, even though that was not
intended. If you immediately press the `BACKSPACE` key after the expansion, the
action is reverted and the trigger recovered.

You can also disable this behavior by adding the following line on your
`default.yml` file:

```yaml
undo_backspace: false
```

> Note that backspace undo is not available for every match, namely the ones
> that specify a [Cursor Hint](../matches/#cursor-hints)
