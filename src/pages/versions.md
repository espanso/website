# Versions

There are currently two versions available:

-   The [new v2 version (beta)](/docs/get-started/) is a brand new rewrite with
    many new features and improvements. We recommend all new users to use this
    version, as the previous one is not being actively maintained anymore.

-   The [legacy version 0.7.3](/docs/legacy/get-started/) is the first edition.
    Given that this version is no longer in active development, we recommend
    users to choose the new version instead, which comes with many new
    improvements and features.
